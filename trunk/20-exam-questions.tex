\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{2013}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw and argue through a photodiode.
\item Explain the time domain ($\tau = R\cdot C$) of a photo diode.
\item Draw and argue through a photodiode circuit with feedback and cascode.
\item Draw and argue through a WTA circuit given all is in subthreshold, and $I_2$ current is bigger than $I_1$.
\subitem Given current source 1 has voltage x, current source 2 has voltage y, and the bias voltage is z, what are the voltages of all the nodes in the circuit.
\item What is $U_T$ and what does it stand for (Knowing the formula $U_T=\frac{kT}{q}$ is NOT enough! What does it physically mean?)
\end{itemize}
